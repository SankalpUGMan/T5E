									A Brief History of T5E
										</center>
									</font>
								</label>
										<p>
In 2002, The Fourth Estate or TFE came into being to bring together the institute’s literary talents on a common platform to write about institute events and activities. This institute magazine covered essays, opinion pieces, news and fiction. Published and circulated in the form of hard copies, the magazine made for a really fun read and was mandated as an institute body under SAC and funded by the Dean of Students.

In 2009, TFE, as it was popularly known, evolved into its online avatar, The Fifth Estate, under three founding editors: Saranya Kapur, Amrita Nair and Aditya (‘Das’) Kothari. For a brief while, both TFE and T5E coexisted and were managed by the same team. However, TFE was discontinued soon and it is the online avatar that remained. Today, T5E has expanded to become the official institute news body and takes on serious reporting under its mandate as well as a host of feature pieces and more, as you shall see below.

								<p>			
T5E, or The Fifth Estate, is IIT Madras’s official campus news and media body. Established relatively recently in 2009, T5E is responsible for reporting on campus events and activities and also bringing out content on a wide range of issues relevant to the IIT Madras community, be it students (prospective or current), parents, faculty or staff. In the last few years, T5E has expanded drastically in terms of outreach and content, and made a name for itself in the institute. One of its main distinguishing features is that it remains neutral and unbiased both in its coverage and internal functioning, having prided itself on working in a transparent and accountable manner.

							</label>
								<p>
As mentioned above, T5E covers institute wide news of every kind including various activities and events on campus – but our content is not confined to reporting. We also regularly bring out different series, features (like Humans of Insti), interviews, op-eds, opinion pieces, and on occasion guest features. Of late, T5E has also begun to focus on not just textual but also visual content and at the moment we are working on several new photography and videography ventures to be released in the coming year.

							</label>
								<p>
T5E operates purely online through a WordPress site where content is regularly published. On average we release 3-4 articles a week. We also run our own Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts. All aspects of T5E: from writing, editing, design, photography, videography, web operations, financing and publicity- are taken care of within the main team itself. Thus, we are an extremely self-sufficient body. But the real answer to ‘How do we do it?’ lies in our team members.

									<p>
The T5E team is headed by an Executive Editor, who takes up ultimate responsibility for the body as a whole. The Exec Ed works with the Editorial Board consisting this year of four editors; the Media Team consisting of six heads responsible for Design, Photography and Videography; and the Web-Ops Head. The real strength of the team however is derived from its correspondents. This year T5E has 32 correspondents who work in tandem with the Headitors and Exec Ed to come up with ideas, take initiative and develop this into solid and effective content.
